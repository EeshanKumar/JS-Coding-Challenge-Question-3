Model a library using objects. *  
A library contains shelves. Shelves contain books. Books have an author and a title. Give the library methods to add and remove a shelf. A shelf should have methods to add/remove a book. Use a modular approach so that each type of object is contained in its own file. Add any functionality you think appropriate.

<br/><br/>
Shelf Name: <input id = "shelfName" type = "text" name = "name" size = "15">
Book Title: <input id = "bookTitle" type = "text" name = "title" size = "30">
Book Author: <input id = "bookAuthor" type = "text" name = "author" size = "30">
<br/><br/>
<input id="addShelf" type = "button" value = "Add Shelf" />
<input id="removeShelf" type = "button" value = "Remove Shelf" />
<input id="addBook" type = "button" value = "Add Book" />
<input id="removeBook" type = "button" value = "Remove Book" />
<br/><br/>
